# NAHI - Your Online Shopping Experience

This React application provides a simple and intuitive online shopping experience. Browse our shop, add items to your cart, and contact us with any questions. You can also log in to manage your account (although the login functionality in this basic version might be a placeholder).

## Features

* **Home:** A welcoming page for your online store.
* **Shop:** Browse available products. (Note: This version likely doesn't have actual product data fetching implemented).
* **Contact:** A page to get in touch with us.
* **Cart:** View and manage items in your shopping cart.
* **Cart Status:** A visual indicator in the navigation bar showing the number of items in your cart.
* **Login:** A basic login page (functionality might be limited in this version).
* **Navigation:** Easy navigation between different sections of the application.

## Technologies Used

* **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **React Router:** For handling navigation between different components (pages).
* **Context API:** For managing the shopping cart state across different components.
* **CSS:** For basic styling (imported from `./App.css`).

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

    This will run the application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
